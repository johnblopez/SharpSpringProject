# SharpSpringProject
1. Run c1.sql to set up the database. The script imports a few records for convenience.
2. Fire up index.php in your browser and login to begin the application (username: 'test', password: '$sh4rpspr1nG$' as specified in the requirements)
3. Due to constraints (no admin/install privileges on my development machine...long story) urls needed to be routed manually without the benefit of Lumen. Ajax was used for all but one request, essentially making it a single-page web application.
4. I hope you have as much fun trying it out as I had writing it. Please feel free to contact me with any questions, comments or otherwise. Thank you for your time and consideration!
